    "**Pandas** is useful for data manipulation and data analysis. It offers users the ability to use pre-made data structures and operations that will do all the data manipulation for us. Pandas also makes use of some of the functions of Numpy, so you will see things like element-by-element computation that can be done with Numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas will put data into a **DataFrame** (basically, a table), which we can interact with and use for our data analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, in row $\\#2$, the date was $04/16/2020$, there were $56$ states with a positive value of $663260$ and a negative value of $2737804$, and so on...\n",
